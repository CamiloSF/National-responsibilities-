Approach of peaper "A GIS-based policy support tool to determine national responsibilities and priorities for biodiversity conservation" 

1) Starts with the selection of the species to be analyzed. The distribution pattern is then classified as “local,” “regional,” or “wide” based on the shapefiles of the reference area and the focal areas, and the distribution of the species. 
  

My Approach 

To classify the range of distribution of the species. I create a function to evaluate the range of the species over a given shp.
For this version I have used the distribution of with a PNN Chingaza Shapefile. I think that this Approach can be used to evaluate the distribution area in any geographic unit.
